1) Func. validate: will check if a string is a number using regex
2) Funct. validateS: will check if a string is made of only one character and its defined.
3) Funct. LetterCheck: will check if at least one character from string a is in string b.
4) Funct. relations: will parse all the words and check if they have at least one letter in common (using function LetterCheck).
If there is then it will mark in the boolean matrix with true, othrwise false
After that it will pass this new matrix and for every word it will create a new string containing the words that have a letter in common.
5) Funct. printR: will print an array of strings (size n).
6) Funct. cycle3: it will check if 3 words (W1 W2 W3) are neighbours in this way W1 <-> W2 <-> W3 <-> W1.
7) MAIN :  it will validate the parameters from args. If the input is valid it will generate n words of size p with the given alphabet.
After that it will call the function relations with the necesary parameters.
